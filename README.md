# g1lbertCFW
# This project is presented by the san antonio detective unit (selfisht, PrimePlatypus, LukeZGD, and frog)!

The first untethered jailbreak for all versions of iOS 5.

This project is now in the public beta stage. You may encounter some bugs and problems, but they should be far and few.

THIS DOES NOT PRESERVE YOUR BASEBAND! Do not cry to us if your baseband is updated.

This project is not being as actively updated anymore, as it is where we want it to be for the most part. Development for g1lbertJB is still in progress, however, and the jailbreak packages here will be updated to reflect such.

g1lbertCFW supports ALL A5 devices running ALL versions of iOS 5!

g1lbertCFW only works on macOS right now, but should be relatively easy to get working on Linux.

Welcome to g1lbertCFW, a tool to create custom CFWs with g1lbertJB beta packed into them. This currently supports all A5(X) devices!
This script was created for bug reports to be submitted. Please join our discord at https://discord.gg/kWmGBSUhyW!

To use, run gilbertCFW with your current version as an argument and follow the instructions from there!

This script will not restore your device for you. It is made for people who know what they're doing. Don't come to us if you break your phone doing something stupid.

Don't ask for ETAs on other devices and versions. They will come soon.

Thanks to everyone on the team for making this possible, and all of our testers!
