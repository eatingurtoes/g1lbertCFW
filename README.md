# Platform support

g1lbertCFW supports macOS and Linux.

# Before using

This script will not restore your device for you. It is made for people who know what they're doing. Don't come to us if you break your phone doing something stupid.

Don't ask for ETAs on other devices and versions. They will come soon.

# How to use

Install Python >=3.6. Your python version must support f-strings. Mac users may need to run the certificate command file that is included with the pkg file, if you
downloaded from a pkg file.  
If you downloaded from homebrew, most likely that was already applied, so you should be fine.

Please, do not include "<" or ">" in the actual command.

To use g1lbert, just enter `./g1lbert -i <your ipsw here>`

If you don't have an ipsw, that's fine. Enter `./g1lbert -d <device> -v <iOS> -b <buildid>`

If you're not sure what to enter, all of the info you need to enter can be found by running `./g1lbert -l`  
Enter the values you would like to use to download an ipsw.
