Welcome to g1lbertCFW, a tool to create custom CFWs with g1lbertJB beta packed into them. Currently, this only makes iPhone 4s iOS 5.1 .ipsws.
This script was created for bug reports to be submitted. Please join our discord at https://discord.gg/kWmGBSUhyW!

This script will not restore your iPhone for you. It is made for people who know what they're doing. Don't come to us if you break your phone doing something stupid.

Don't ask for ETAs on other devices and versions. They will come soon.

Big thanks to dora for making powdersn0w and allowing us to make bundles much faster and more efficiently!

Thanks to everyone on the team for making this possible, and meeza for helping with testing!
